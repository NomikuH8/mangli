## Mangli, a cli client for mangadex.org

how to use:

`mangli <manga-id> <volumes>`

`<manga-id>` is located in the url. it looks like this: `123abc3b-fedc-1b2l-987bdc09` 

`<volumes>` are the volumes that you want to download. e.g.: `1 4-6 8 9`

a volume can be `none`. the `none` volume contains chapters without volume, that may be waiting it to finish. 
    
get more options, like download and convert a single chapter (not yet implemented):
`mangli <manga-id>`
