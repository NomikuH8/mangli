decided to make it in go.

1. I want to learn go
2. The libraries for creating TUI (terminal user interface) in python suck

maybe I'll make this a cli app like

`mangli <manga-id>`

`mangli [options] <manga-id> <volume>`

`mangli [options] <manga-id> <volume> <chapter>`

options:
- -d, --download: download manga
- -c, --convert: convert to pdf
- -r, --remove-img: remove images after convert

## Mangli, a cli client for mangadex.org
Still in development. Being rewritten too.
